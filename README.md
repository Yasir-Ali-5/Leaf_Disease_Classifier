# 🍃 Leaf Disease Classifier 🌿

A simple yet effective machine learning project that classifies plant leaf diseases using image-based features. This project is implemented in a **single Python file** for ease of understanding and quick prototyping.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Plant health is critical for agriculture and ecosystem stability. This Leaf Disease Classifier detects various leaf diseases using image processing and a trained machine learning model, helping farmers and agriculturalists make informed decisions.

## 🧠 How It Works

- 📥 Loads and processes leaf images
- 🧹 Applies preprocessing (resize, normalize)
- 🎨 Extracts relevant features (color, texture, shape)
- 🤖 Uses a trained ML model (e.g., Random Forest / CNN)
- 🔍 Predicts the disease category
